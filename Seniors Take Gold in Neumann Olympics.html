            Students in grades 6-12 competed in the annual Neumann Olympics event on Friday.

            Neumann students represented their graduating classes in a number of different events including various relay races, tug-of-war, and other events organized by Mr. Lindsey, the Physical Education teacher.

            The middle school and high school grades competed in separate competitions. Each event earned points toward each grade’s total, which was tallied at the end. Seniors and Eighth graders won their respective competitions, earning spirit sticks they will carry until next year’s games.

            At the end of games, students went head-to-head with teachers in a game of West Chester volleyball until the end of the day.

            The most contentious competition of the games was between Juniors and the Seniors.

            “I think that the seniors should’ve gotten second place and that the juniors were the best class,” Junior Lucas Bower said. “I think we should’ve won because we all tied for first in the hula hoop contest, but had the most people still left and our egg during the Spoon-and-Egg race was broken.”

            “The seniors were the rightful champions because we all knew our strengths and weaknesses and used that to our advantage,” Senior Saniye Loyd said. “That’s why we came out on top. They need more team chemistry. All of the seniors participated and we got on the field.”
