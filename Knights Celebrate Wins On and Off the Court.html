                Students and faculty from both campuses and speakers close to the Neumann community crowded the gym last Friday to give the Neumann boys an energetic send-off before their 82 to 62 win over Nativity in the PIAA Class A semi-finals.

                Principal McNamee welcomed the crowd, excited to be celebrating Neumann successes after a difficult few school years, which have impacted the everyone in some way across the nation. “It’s great to see everyone here supporting our team after 2 years of difficulties,” McNamee said. “The entire community is behind you all.” Principal McNamee said the recent season of both boys and girls were important reminders that Neumann sports and academics are closely related and equal examples of how the Neumann community continues to excel. She honored all junior and senior high students who made honor roll so far this year by asking them to stand.

                Boys head coach, Jamie Spencer, wanted to thank the community for showing their support for both the boys and girls team throughout the season. Spencer highlighted specific moments he remembered from the season where the girls team had been here to support the boys throughout their season, even as early as their first scrimmages. “Experiences like this have been what’s continuously pushed our boys to get this far,” Spencer said. “And we’re not done yet.”

                Accomplished athlete, coach, and educator close to the Neumann community, Marilouise “Maz” Mazzante, shared many wise words directed at the team and the students sitting behind them. “This is an opportunity in front of you that you might only have once in your life,” Maz said. “Now is your time to claim it.”

                Head baseball coach, Cory Burkholder, spoke about how important academics are to the athletes who go to this school. “All these boys sitting here stood to be honored today,” Burkholder said. Fathers Bechtel and Kozen closed the afternoon with a prayer.

                On Thursday, the boys will be going up against Pittsburgh’s Bishop Canevin in Hershey for the title. Students were reminded on morning announcements Tuesday that it has been 50 years since anything like this has happened for Neumann basketball.
