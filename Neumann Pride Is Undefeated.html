                    <strong>Despite season end, history has been made</strong>

                    Neumann pride was on full display Thursday as the school celebrated the many achievements the basketball team has had leading up to the final game. Despite the Knight’s 64 to 47 loss Thursday at the Giant Center, in Hershey, the school rallied around the young men and the school spirit they’ve brought to life this year.

                    The boys were welcomed into the gym for a final celebration before the school send-off to Hershey. “When our players were kids they began their love for the game of basketball. A love that was instilled in them by their fathers, brothers, uncles, friends, and coaches,” said Shawn Moore, Director of Religious Formation at Neumann. “Countless hours of practice … wins and losses, hundreds of miles logged journeying from school to school, they learned what it meant to be competitive athletes. They learned that no one was going to hand them a win, rather they would have to earn every victory.” Moore’s statements struck a chord with the crowd as they were a reminder of just how historic this season was for Neumann.

                    Most of Thursday’s speakers emphasized how this was a once-in-a-lifetime team and how they’ve cemented their impact into the school’s history, regardless of the result of the final game. This team has one thing that sets them apart from the others – love for the game and each other. “When you get a group of men together like this, a group that loves one another, that plays for one another … that is something that only the very best teams can accomplish,” Moore said. Every time they went on the court, they played for one another.

                    Neumann’s mission going into this challenge was made clear by head baseball coach Cory Burkholder. “We are faithful and powered by faith,” he said. “Remember that is what you all represent here. You are your brother’s keepers in this mission.”

                    The atmosphere before the game was intense as the school traveled in large numbers to Hershey. Long lines of Neumann fans crowded the front of the arena as they waited for the boys game to begin. To the players, this was a breathtaking experience being in front of so many eyes both in person and at home. Many of the speakers Thursday reminded the players to savor every moment and make the most of every second to carry as memories. They did.

                    “I am proud that you’ve used the gifts you’ve been given to overcome challenges and adversity in a way that sets you apart over and above so many others,” Bishop Joseph C. Bambera said.
