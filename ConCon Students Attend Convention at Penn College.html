                    St. John Neumann students participated in a Mock Constitutional Convention before Christmas Break.

                <p>
                    On Dec. 8th, Neumann's ConCon club traveled to Penn College to participate in the 2023 mock constitutional convention.

                    The students have been preparing for the event since September. Teams were split up into delegates and in order to go, each delegation assigned to a state had to write a resolution of something that would change the Constitution and would be favored by their state.

                <p>
                    At the convection, each delegation was split into committees and each committee would then vote on resolutions in the morning and if they passed would be voted on in the afternoon session with everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This opportunity was open to students in grades 9-12 and students will have the opportunity to go to mock United Nations in the spring where they will be assigned to represent countries.
