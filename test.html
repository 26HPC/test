                The St. John Neumann Key Club has decided to do an “E-Drive,” continuing with the theme of recycling. When thinking of recycling, you envision throwing plastic into the appropriate bin so the plastic does not end up on the ground, but there’s a lot more to it than that.

                The electronics we use every day often have no place in our homes once they have run their course and people throw them away, but do not consider the environmental consequences. That’s why Key Club came up with the idea to organize an event where anyone can come to drop their old electronics for no charge.

                Held in the parking lot of the high school, the E-drive is open to everyone. In the club this year we really wanted to focus on making recycling a part of everyday life and allowing everyone to participate. We‘ve already implemented recycling bins into each room of the school and now we’re extending that to the community. Using our new process, we’ll ensure that the school and community remain safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly!
