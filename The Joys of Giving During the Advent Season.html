                    This year at Neumann, we decided to help those in need by organizing an Advent food drive. We had a different designated food item every day to bring in for a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Twelve Days of Service food items included canned fruit, box of cereal, ketchup and mustard, peanut butter, canned cranberry sauce, boxed dessert mix, boxed crackers, boxed pancake mix, spaghetti sauce, boxed pasta, canned soup, and canned veggies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ended up bringing in a lot of donations and volunteers from different grades of the school unloaded the donations at the food drive. Neumann’s Director of Religious Formation, Andrew McCarrol, organized the drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When asked what inspired the food drive, McCarrol said “For advent, we prepare for Christmas and gifts. What better way to give back to our community by giving them the joy of Christmas as well?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The food drive had been a success, and it was truly an experience to be able to give back to our community and help those in need.
