                There are many benefits to a high school maintaining a student-run news outlet. Not only does it provide the entire community with informative and entertaining stories about the school, it has the potential to provide educational experiences for the students running it. Students brainstorm, write, edit, and illustrate every story. And for the past several years, since the paper moved to a digital format, it has also provided a way for students to learn how to build and maintain a website.
            </p>
            <h1>How to use the website</h1>
            <p>
                The website is built in such a way that the most timely and informative articles are on the front page at the top of the page – the first place your eye goes when you visit the site. The first two stories are the most recent and important. The following four are older, less current stories. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are five main tabs in the heading: School-News, World-News, Knights’ Knowledge (opinions), Sports, and Student Experiences/Achievements. All articles are classified as one of those. When one of those tabs is clicked on, you will be taken to its page. Those pages operate the same as the homepage, but all the stories on it will be related to the page’s topic. There is one more tab, the “About” tab. This page contains information about the website, the writers, and other miscellaneous information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The articles themselves are not formatted any differently than a normal new site. Though all of the text is original, it is formatted in a way that readers would expect a website to be. It will contain writing, media, a byline, and anything else that may be needed. 
            </p>
            <h1>How I made it</h1>
            <p>
                Not every device is made equal. The website could be viewed on a computer, which is traditionally displayed in landscape, or on a phone, which is traditionally displayed in portrait. To fix this issue, the website displays itself differently depending on what kind of device is being used. None of the information changes, just the formatting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On desktop, there are two columns: the left column, which contains the written text of the article; and the right column, which contains everything else, like important images and the byline. On mobile-view, there is just one column. What would be in the right column on desktop-view, on mobile, displays at the top of the article, before everything else, but just after the title.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The heading is also different on desktop-view and mobile-view. On desktop-view, there are two lines. The first line contains the logo, and the website’s name is next to it. The second line contains the buttons: the tabs, aligned to the left; and the social-buttons, aligned to the right. On mobile-view, everything is displayed in four lines: the logo, then the website’s name, then the social-buttons, then the tabs. 
            </p>
            <h1>Technical details</h1>
            <p>
                I “coded” the website from scratch. It is written in two languages: HTML and CSS. HTML, Hyper-Text Markup Language, is used only to classify text. The text that I want the website to display is plainly written into an HTML document. After that, HTML notations are added, so that the computer knows what it is looking at. By itself, that is all that HTML can do. When partnered with CSS, Cascading Style Sheet(s), much more can be accomplished. CSS is used to make aesthetic designs on the website. The CSS code is all typed in a separate document. Because the HTML files have so much classification for their text, the computer knows what parts of the CSS code apply to certain parts of the text.
            </p>
            <strong>Display</strong>
            <p>
                As previously mentioned, the website displays differently on different devices. In order to make this happen, some of the CSS information has to be changed. Luckily, I don’t have to rewrite the CSS file for each different device; I select individual properties, primarily the spacing, which will display differently. The distinctions are made based on the resolution of the screen, not the type of device that is being used. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it would take more effort to fix than the benefits of doing so, there is a small range of resolutions where the header will display in mobile view, but everything else displays in desktop view. As far as I know, Amazon E-Reader tablets are the only devices that display content in this manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                E-readers are not typically used for browsing the internet- some of them can’t even display color, so I doubt that anyone would have ever known, had I not said something. Even so, these tablets are intended to be used in portrait-mode anyway, so the heading being in mobile-view doesn’t create any problems. Because they are tablets, the rest of the website displaying in desktop-view still looks and feels normal.
            </p>
            <strong>Media</strong>
            <p>
                There are times where the website needs to display things like images, or maybe even videos. There are two different classifications for media files:
                <ul>
                    <li>“img”</li>
                    <li>or “img port”</li>
                </ul>
                Media files that are classified as “img” (short for “image”) are the files that go inside the articles. Files that are classified as “img port” (short for “image portable”) are all the files that are used in multiple places. These include things like the website’s logo, the Facebook icon in the header, or the camera emoji. When uploading a new version of these files, it needs to be more carefully considered. Changing instance of it across the site with one upload is convenient, but may lead to unintended consequences.
            </p>
            <h1>Plans for Future</h1>
            <p>
                In the future, there are some improvements that could be made. Some of them just involve cleaning up and simplifying the code — a feature that few would notice, but would help me, the programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the website does work on both desktop and mobile, there are slight formatting glitches that appear at times on mobile. They are nothing serious that hinders the user, just unintended ways that the content appears. An example would be that the images are justified to the left, when the should be centered; or they are all the same height, when they should instead be the same width. I doubt that many people will look at the website on mobile, if at all. For those who do look at it on mobile, I doubt that they will care about an uncentered image.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest plan that I have for the future is to redesign the header for mobile devices. Currently, the mobile header is the same concept as desktop: a series, containing all the different tabs and important links. A more efficient design would be to use a hamburger menu. A hamburger menu occupies the entire screen, but only shows up when the user wants it to. When in an article’s page, the user would press the menu button to pull up the menu’s options. To close the menu, the user would press the X button. The menu would contain all the same information, but it could be more easily designed, as space would not be as serious a concern anymore.
