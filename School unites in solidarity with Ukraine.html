                    On March 25, the solemnity of the Annunciation, the entire Catholic Church joined in a worldwide prayer of consecration of Ukraine and Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. At 6:30 (Rome time) the Pope took part in a service containing the holy sacrifice of the Mass and Reconciliation along with the prayer of consecration of Ukraine and Russia.

                    At the same time, here at St. John Neumann, the school prayed the prayer of consecration. Along with the prayer the school sang the Divine Mercy chaplet using Rosaries donated by a Neumann family. 9th grader Sophia Reid said, “It was nice we took time out of the school today to pray for world events.” Romee Woodring 11th grader said, “I thought it was beautiful to see the whole school praying together for the world.”

                    The Consecration was at the request of Our Lady of Fatima who in 1917 asked that the whole world consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart. Now the Pope has seen the need to consecrate Russia for peace reflecting on what Mary told the children in Fatima: “My immaculate heart will triumph.”
