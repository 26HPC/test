                    On Tuesday of Catholic Schools Week St. John Neumann Elementary students joined high school students at the High School campus for a morning of activities. Each high school grade was assigned an elementary school grade to escort through their activities.

                The English, Math, History, Science, Gym, Music, and Language departments each organized fun activities for the students. Some of the activities included an NFL geography quiz, English Bingo, Sphero robot race, Science experiments, and an addition and subtraction activity using Skittles for math.

                Junior Thomas Whaley said “ My favorite activity was playing the geography game with my buddy.” Many other students enjoyed the time they got with the elementary kids.
