                    St. John Neumann Regional Academy High School students participated in the PA March for Life Oct. 16.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nine SJNRA students joined hundreds on the steps of Pennsylvania’s State Capitol for the PA March for Life on Oct. 16.

                <p>
                    Before the march, students toured St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the principal church of the Diocese of Harrisburg. After the tour of the cathedral, students entered the Capitol and visited the Governor’s reception room.

                    Students then listened to speakers who pushed for PA legislators to ban abortion in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The march was especially important the last two years following the June 2022 Supreme Court decision to overturn the federal right to abortion, leaving the decision up to state legislators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The march was organized by the March for Life and Pennsylvania Family Institute.
