          Durring Catholic Schools Week, Neumann High School welcomed Brittany Fischer, a representative from the YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association) to come and talk to us about what they do there. YWCA, not to be confused with the YMCA, is a non-profit that, among other things, runs shelters across the world for anyone in need of somewhere to stay. This was the main focus of the presentation. Despite the name including the word "women", YWCA shelters are open to anyone, regardless of age, money, ethnicity, gender, status, etc..

          An important topic discussed was the importance of not stereotyping "homeless people". People who need somewhere to stay could become that way for a variety of reasons, usually do to circumstances beyond their control. Fischer explained that anyone can find themselves in a vulnerable situation, regardless of age, money, ethnicity, gender, status, etc..

          The presentation ended with Fischer saying that any St. John Neumann students in need of service hours can always volunteer their time at the YWCA shelter in Williamsport.
