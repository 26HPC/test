                    Red Ribbon week highlights the importance of a drug and bully free life. The week of October 23rd, to October 27th here at Neumann, we showed our support to the cause by learning different facts and methods to put an end to drug use and bullying.

                    We kicked off the week with our “Follow your dreams and stay drug free” day. Everyone came to school in their pajamas. It was amazing to see most everyone participate in this fun and comfy day! Also on Monday, we had an announcement come on every 39 minutes  saying that a drunk driving accident had occurred. Unfortunately, on average, that is the occurrence rate of these accidents in Pennsylvania. It might’ve been a small start, but it could possibly lead to more drug and alcohol free driving! Tuesday, we had our “Do not FALL for drugs'' day. Everyone came in wearing a fall flannel to support the cause.

                    On Wednesday, the entire school wore spirit wear and created bold signs that supported being drug and bully free. That afternoon, the middle school/high school walked the streets of Williamsport holding their signs and holding a prayer service. It truly was a riveting experience.

                    On Thursday, we had our “destructive decisions don’t discriminate” day or generation day, for short. Each grade had a themed dress down for the specific generation they were assigned. Our sixth graders were babies, seventh graders were toddlers, eighth graders were school age (their task wasn’t hard!)The freshmen dressed as college students, the sophomore class were parents and the working class, the juniors were retired, and finally, our seniors were “senior” citizens. It truly was surprising to see how many people actually participated, and it was an overall exciting day.

                    Finally, on Friday, we celebrated our “be the light is somebody’s darkness’’ day. The interesting day began with an emotional assembly with an appearance by Pennsylvania’s Coroner. Students learned the risks of driving under the influence, and all the consequences it may have. Later that day, we practiced our ALICE evacuation drill and reconvened at Lycoming College. All Neumann students and staff dressed in all black and to finish off the day, everybody wore glow sticks and had a glowing party in the gymnasium. There was dancing, laughter, and lots of neon colors and everybody seemed to have an amazing time.

                    This year's Red Ribbon Week was celebrated in many special ways here at SJNRA, and it seemed as though everyone enjoyed and cherished all the information and fun activities we participated in during that exceptional week. During Red Ribbon week, youth and adults throughout the nation increase their knowledge about drug abuse and misuse and living a drug free and healthy lifestyle. Red Ribbon week at Neumann was a good start, but we will continue to keep drug free a goal in our daily lives.
